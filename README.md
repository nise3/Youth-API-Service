# NISE3 Youth API Service

## Following 3 branches are protected and among them develop branch is the default branch:
```shell
master
staging
develop
```

```master``` branch is only being used for production release.
Code of master branch has not been used. We are using container image from staging branch to deploy to production.
Common configurations should be placed in the ```.env.example``` file.

## Development Environment
Sensitive information like different type of credentials for development environment have to be configured in the file named ```deploy/values.dev.yaml```.

In order to release in the development environment, we have to switch to ```develop``` branch and after that we have to increase the value of the property ```devBuildImageVersion``` in ```deploy/version.yaml```.

After that we have to write a commit message ```RELEASE = 'php artisan migrate'``` if we want to do any database migration after the release. But, if we don't
want to run any command after the release then the commit message will be ```RELEASE = 'php artisan list'```.

## Staging Environment
Sensitive information like different type of credentials for staging environment have to be configured in the file named ```deploy/values.staging.yaml```.

In order to release in the staging environment, we have to switch to ```staging``` branch and after that  we have to increase the value of the property ```stagingBuildImageVersion``` in ```deploy/version.yaml```.

After that we have to write a commit message ```RELEASE = 'php artisan migrate'``` if we want to do any database migration after the release. But, if we don't
want to run any command after the release then the commit message will be ```RELEASE = 'php artisan list'```.

## Production Environment
Sensitive information like different type of credentials for production environment have to be configured in the file named ```deploy/values.production.yaml```.

In order to release in the production environment, we have to switch to ```master``` branch and after that  we have to set successful version of the staging environment value of ```stagingBuildImageVersion``` and
make a git push. This will successfully release the desired version of staging environment container image to production environment.

## Initial Setup

git clone git_project_url
cd project_folder
